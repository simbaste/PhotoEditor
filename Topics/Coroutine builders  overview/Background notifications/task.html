<h2>Background notifications</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>Loading data from the server can be a long operation, so we want to entertain a user while the computer is busy loading the content. To do that let's launch a function that writes a message every second that the app is still alive. When the loading is done our app should finish and so should our loading and notification functions.</p>
<p>Start two coroutines. Start `loadData` in a blocking way so the app doesn't finish before it's done. Start `printProgress` in a fire-and-forget way to keep printing the message in the background while the app is running.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> `launch` coroutine builder requires a scope as the receiver, for example `GlobalScope.launch()`</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 2 seconds</font><br><br>
