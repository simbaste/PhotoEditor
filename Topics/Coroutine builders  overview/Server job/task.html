<h2>Server job</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>Our job is to connect to the server and load some data from it. We already have convenient functions <code class="java">connectToServer</code> and <code class="java">loadData</code> implemented and imported for us. All we need to do is call them in the right order. We also need to make sure that loading starts after the connection is established (when function <code class="java">connectToServer</code> returns).</p>
<p>Both <code class="java">connectToServer</code> and <code class="java">loadData</code> are suspending functions, so we'll need to use a builder to call them.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
