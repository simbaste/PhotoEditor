<h2>Blocking until done</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>I have an application that validates server connection, if it works the application is happy and can safely exit. It does the check by calling suspending function <code class="java">connectToServer</code>. But the connection is slow and the app needs to wait until the function returns before it can report the success. Can you help to fix the app?</p>
<p>Fix the call of <code class="java">connectToServer</code> by wrapping it with proper coroutine builder.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
